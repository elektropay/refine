"The mother of all demo apps" â€” Exemplary fullstack [Medium.com](https://medium.com/) clone powered by Refine!

While most "todo" demos provide an excellent cursory glance at a framework's capabilities, they typically don't convey the knowledge & perspective required to actually build real applications with it.

[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) solves this by allowing you to choose any frontend (React, Angular, & more) and any backend (Node, Django, & more) and see how they power a real world, beautifully designed fullstack app called [Conduit](https://demo.realworld.io/#/).
